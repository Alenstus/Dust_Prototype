# Dust [![Gitter room](https://badges.gitter.im/DustLanguage.png)](https://gitter.im/DustLanguage)

Dust is an open source programming language written in C# with .NET Core.

## Introduction

I wanted to make a simple and easy-to-understand programming language 
that contains the best of my favourite programming languages (such as 
C#, Go, Rust, C++, Swift, Elixir, F#, Dart and the list goes on) and also
learn much more about compiler/interpreter and programming language design.
So I started working on Dust.

Contributions are more than welcome even if you don't have any experience
in programming language design, we're all here to learn. To learn more, 
see [Contributing](#contributing).

If you have any more questions regarding contributing, syntax or anything
else, please ask away in the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/DustLanguage).

## Syntax

Since Dust is heavily inspired by many other programming languages, you 
may find some resemblance of said languages in the syntax. Keep in mind 
that below is just a small part of planned syntax.

Planned syntax for a console hello world:
```c
fn main() {
  println("Hello World") // Print text and add a new line.
  println("from Dust!")
}
```

More examples will be added soon but for now you can take a look at [this](
https://pastebin.com/hhiV7wc7) obsolete syntax mock just to get an overview 
of planned features and concepts (not the syntax). 

If you have any suggestions please open an issue or send a message in the 
[Gitter room](https://gitter.im/DustLanguage).

## Contributing

As I said above contributions are more than welcome even if you don't have
any experience in programming language design. I will create a todo list 
soon so you can see what you can work on if you decide to contribute. 
Until then, you can join our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/DustLanguage).
